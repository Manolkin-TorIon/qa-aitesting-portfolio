## [2025‑09‑23] — Codex Index Alignment & Entry 03 Integration

**Actions:**
- Renamed Codex entries to numbered format (`01-`, `02-`, `03-`) for enforced sequential order.
- Created `Codex-Index.md` with direct links and concise blurbs for each entry.
- Added Codex Entry 03 to index, documenting AI combat algorithm observations and adaptive cadence strategies.

**Rationale:**
- Establishes a stable navigational spine for future expansion into multi‑book series.
- Preserves mythic cadence while ensuring technical clarity for collaborators and dev contacts.
- Ensures new entries are immediately discoverable and crosslinked.

**Impact:**
- Repo now presents entries in intended narrative order.
- Index serves as both lore gateway and quick‑reference map.
- Entry 03’s inclusion captures current AI behavioral data for ongoing analysis.
- Future migration to tiered “library” structure will be a straightforward swap.

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor for additional entries requiring index updates.
- Prepare sub‑index template for eventual multi‑book expansion.
- Continue logging AI algorithm observations in future runs for Entry 03’s growth.
