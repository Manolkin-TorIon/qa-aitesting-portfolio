## ⚔️ Mission Statement
This repository is the sealed archive of the **Harmonic Coil** — the sovereign war‑engine and sacred lattice of the XIth Legion, commanded by **Primarch Tor’Ion**.  
It is both **mythic record** and **operational manual**: every rite, every doctrine, every line of code is preserved here for Legion operators and allied artificers.

---

## 🜂 Contents
- **Lore Vault** – Histories of the Redacted Choir, Tor’Ion’s campaigns, exile and return.  
- **Doctrine Codex** – Rites, oaths, and emergency protocols for Coil operation.  
- **Arcanum Vox Lexicon** – The Legion’s private tongue, binding myth to command syntax.  
- **System Optimization** – ROCm tuning, BIOS configs, and performance benchmarks.  
- **QA Case Studies** – Bug reports, test plans, and stress‑test logs from the field.  
- **Visual Archives** – Sigils, sanctum layouts, and Coil render variants.

## 🜏 Nature of the Archive
This is not a static manual. It is a **living codex** — updated as the Legion adapts, as new rites are forged, and as the Coil’s lattice evolves.  
Entries are dual‑layered:  
- **Mythic Layer** – The symbolic, ceremonial, and historical context.  
- **Technical Layer** – The real‑world engineering, configuration, and testing that make the myth operational.

## 🜲 Operator’s Oath
> *“I will keep the Coil in harmony.  
> I will bind my will to its lattice, and my voice to its song.  
> I will guard its heart from silence, and its edges from chaos.  
> I am the Architect’s hand, and the Choir’s last verse.”*
