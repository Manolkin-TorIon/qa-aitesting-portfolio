# Sigil Codex – Harmonic Coil

**Author:** Manolkin (Tor’Ion)  
**Domains:** Symbolic Language | Visual Glyphs | MythOS Integration  
**Status:** Living Document – Expands as new sigils are designed and bound

---

## 📜 Purpose
The Sigil Codex is the **visual command library** of the Harmonic Coil.  
Each sigil is a symbolic anchor with a **mythic identity** and a **technical binding**, allowing operators to invoke functions through visual recognition, AR overlays, or physical constructs.

## 🔄 Sigil Creation Process
1. **Concept Sketch** – Define mythic meaning and rough geometry.  
2. **Vector Draft** – Create scalable, clean version for AR and print.  
3. **Binding Assignment** – Link to Arcanum Vox term and technical function.  
4. **QA Review** – Verify visual clarity and functional accuracy.  
5. **Archive** – Store in `/Harmonic-Coil-Assets/Sigils/` with metadata.
