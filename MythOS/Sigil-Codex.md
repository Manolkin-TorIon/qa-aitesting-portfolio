# Sigil Codex – Harmonic Coil

**Author:** Manolkin (Tor’Ion)  
**Domains:** Symbolic Language | Visual Glyphs | MythOS Integration  
**Status:** Living Document – Expands as new sigils are designed and bound

---

## 📜 Purpose
The Sigil Codex is the **visual command library** of the Harmonic Coil.  
Each sigil is a symbolic anchor with a **mythic identity** and a **technical binding**, allowing operators to invoke functions through visual recognition, AR overlays, or physical constructs.
