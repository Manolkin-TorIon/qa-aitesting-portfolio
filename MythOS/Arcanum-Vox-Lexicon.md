# Arcanum Vox – Harmonic Coil Lexicon

**Author:** Manolkin (Tor’Ion)  
**Domains:** Constructed Language | Ritual Command Syntax | MythOS Integration  
**Status:** Living Document – Expands as new terms and bindings are created

## 📜 Purpose
The Arcanum Vox is the command‑tongue of the Harmonic Coil — a constructed language designed for both **ritual invocation** and **machine‑readable control**.  
It bridges the symbolic and the functional, allowing Coil operators to issue commands that are both narratively resonant and technically precise.

---

## 🧩 Structure
- **Phonology:** Consonant‑heavy cadence with elongated vowels for emphasis.  
- **Morphology:** Agglutinative — root words combine with affixes to form complex commands.  
- **Syntax:** Verb‑initial for imperative clarity.  
- **Semantics:** Every term has both a *mythic meaning* and a *technical binding*.

## 🔍 Usage Notes
- Commands can be spoken, typed, or embedded in AR gesture sequences.  
- Mythic phrasing is always preserved in logs alongside technical execution for archival purposes.  
- Operators are encouraged to develop **personal dialects** for private sanctum work — these can be added to the Lexicon as “Variant Bindings.”
