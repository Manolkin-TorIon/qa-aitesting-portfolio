# Harmonic Coil â€“ Visual Design Workflow

**Authors:** Manolkin (Torâ€™Ion) & Copilot  
**Domains:** Mythic Architecture | Ritual Interface | Sovereign Augmentation  
**Status:** Living Document â€“ Updated with new visual motifs and prompt refinements

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To generate consistent, highâ€‘fidelity imagery of the Harmonic Coil for use in lore codices, AR sanctums, and technical documentation â€” blending symbolic resonance with functional design.

---

## ðŸ“œ Prompt Template[Subject: Harmonic Coil node, array, or full construct]
[Key Features: geometry, materials, energy effects, environmental context]
[Mood/Atmosphere: lighting, tone, narrative moment]
[Art Style: cinematic realism, blueprint schematic, or stylized concept art]

---

## ðŸ–‹ Example Prompt: Harmonic Coil central node,
nested spiral rings of bioluminescent alloy and obsidian glass,
auric energy pulses along latticework conduits,
suspended in a voidâ€‘lit sanctum with drifting incense smoke,
cinematic realism, ultraâ€‘wide composition

---

## âš™ Recommended Parameters
- **Resolution:** 2048Ã—2048 for sigil detail, or 1920Ã—1080 for environmental context
- **Seed:** Fixed for iterative refinement
- **Guidance Scale:** 7.5â€“8.5 for balance between adherence and creative variance
- **Negative Prompts:** blurry, warped geometry, text artifacts, inconsistent lighting

## ðŸ§ª QA Checklist â€“ Harmonic Coil Imagery

### Geometry & Structure
- [ ] Spiral and ring proportions match lore specifications
- [ ] Latticework is continuous and free of breaks
- [ ] No floating or disconnected elements unless intentional

### Material Fidelity
- [ ] Bioluminescent alloy glows with correct hue and intensity
- [ ] Obsidian glass reflects environment subtly, without distortion
- [ ] Carbonâ€‘silk textures are visible in closeâ€‘up renders

### Resonance Effects
- [ ] Energy pulses follow lattice pathways
- [ ] Light bleed is controlled and not overpowering
- [ ] Environmental lighting matches Coilâ€™s harmonic state

### Composition
- [ ] Focal point is clear and centered on Coil structure
- [ ] Background supports narrative without distraction
- [ ] No unintended cropping or missing elements

## ðŸ”„ Usage Notes
- Maintain **sigil consistency** across all renders by reusing vector overlays or fixed seeds.
- Test Coil imagery in **both cinematic and schematic styles** for different documentation needs.
- Archive all final renders with prompt, parameters, and seed in `/MythOS/Harmonic-Coil-Assets`.
