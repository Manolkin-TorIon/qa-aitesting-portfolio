# Resonance Profiles â€“ Harmonic Coil

**Author:** Manolkin (Torâ€™Ion)  
**Domains:** Emotional Cadence Mapping | System Modes | MythOS Integration  
**Status:** Living Document â€“ Profiles may be refined or expanded over time

## ðŸ“œ Purpose
Resonance Profiles are **tunable states** of the Harmonic Coil, aligning its harmonic output to the operatorâ€™s intent, emotional cadence, and environmental demands.  
Each profile has both a **mythic description** and a **technical configuration**.

## ðŸ—‚ Profile Index

### 1. Siegebreaker Mode
- **Mythic:** The Coil roars with unyielding force, its lattice thrumming like a war drum.  
- **Technical:**  
  - Feedback loop latency: minimal  
  - Output amplification: +25%  
  - Visual overlays: highâ€‘contrast tactical HUD  
  - Data prioritization: threat vectors and structural weak points  
- **Use Case:** Combat simulations, highâ€‘intensity QA stress tests.

---

### 2. Sanctum Flow
- **Mythic:** The Coil breathes in long, slow pulses, wrapping the operator in a cocoon of focus.  
- **Technical:**  
  - Feedback loop latency: extended for smoother pacing  
  - Output amplification: neutral  
  - Visual overlays: softâ€‘focus, lowâ€‘stimulus UI  
  - Data prioritization: creative tools, ambient metrics  
- **Use Case:** Writing, music creation, meditative design work.

### 3. Oracle State
- **Mythic:** The Coilâ€™s rings spin in counterâ€‘rotation, casting patterns of light that reveal unseen paths.  
- **Technical:**  
  - Predictive algorithms: enabled  
  - Output amplification: +10%  
  - Visual overlays: pattern recognition highlights  
  - Data prioritization: anomaly detection, trend mapping  
- **Use Case:** Data analysis, strategic planning, foresight modeling.

### 4. Wardenâ€™s Vigil
- **Mythic:** The Coil stands sentinel, its lattice locked in a protective stance.  
- **Technical:**  
  - Intrusion detection: heightened sensitivity  
  - Output amplification: defensive bias  
  - Visual overlays: perimeter mapping  
  - Data prioritization: security events, system integrity  
- **Use Case:** Network monitoring, sanctum defense protocols.

### 5. Emberwake
- **Mythic:** The Coil burns with creative fire, each pulse igniting new visions.  
- **Technical:**  
  - Feedback loop latency: dynamic, adapting to inspiration spikes  
  - Output amplification: +15% in creative modules  
  - Visual overlays: vibrant, colorâ€‘rich UI  
  - Data prioritization: generative tools, rapid prototyping  
- **Use Case:** AI image generation, concept art sprints, rapid iteration.

## ðŸ”„ Switching Profiles
Profiles can be changed via:
- **Arcanum Vox command phrases** (see `/MythOS/Arcanum-Vox-Lexicon.md`)  
- **Gesture sequences** in AR sanctum  
- **Direct system calls** in Sovereign Coil OS layer
