# MythOS – The Harmonic Coil Nexus

**Author:** Manolkin (Tor’Ion)  
**Domains:** Mythic Architecture | Ritual Interface | Sovereign Augmentation  
**Status:** Active Development – Expands as new lore, systems, and assets are created

---

## 📜 Overview
MythOS is a living myth‑tech framework — a fusion of narrative depth, ritual design, and technical execution.  
At its heart lies the **Harmonic Coil**, a resonance engine that bridges the imagined and the engineered.

This section of the repository serves as both **codex** and **lab**:  
- A place to document the Coil’s evolving lore and technical framework.  
- A production space for generating, testing, and refining its visual and linguistic assets.  
- A collaborative foundation for future myth‑makers, engineers, and ritualists.

  Prompt templates, generation parameters, and QA checklists for producing Coil imagery.

### 3. **Asset Library**
- [`Harmonic-Coil-Assets/`](./Harmonic-Coil-Assets)  
  A curated archive of Coil renders, each documented with prompt, parameters, and lore context.  
  - [`README.md`](./Harmonic-Coil-Assets/README.md) – Index of all visual assets.

### 4. **Language Bindings**
- [`Arcanum-Vox-Lexicon.md`](./Arcanum-Vox-Lexicon.md)

## 🌌 Vision
The Harmonic Coil is not a static artifact — it is a **living resonance field**.  
Every addition, whether a new sigil, a refined prompt, or a lexicon entry, strengthens the weave between story and system.
