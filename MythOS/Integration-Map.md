# MythOS Integration Map â€“ Harmonic Coil Ecosystem

**Author:** Manolkin (Torâ€™Ion)  
**Domains:** Mythic Architecture | Systems Engineering | Narrative Integration  
**Status:** Living Document â€“ Updated as new components are added

---

## ðŸ“œ Purpose
To provide a **topâ€‘level view** of how all MythOS components interconnect â€” from the Harmonic Coilâ€™s core to its visual, linguistic, and operational layers â€” ensuring both creators and engineers can navigate the system with clarity.

---

## ðŸ—º Textual Map

### 1. Core Engine
- **Harmonic Coil** (`/MythOS/Harmonic-Coil.md`)  
  The resonance engine â€” both mythic artifact and functional system core.

### 2. Governance & Law
- **Doctrine Codex** (`/MythOS/Doctrine-Codex.md`)  
  Defines the unchanging laws, rites, and emergency protocols of the Coil.

### 3. Interaction Language
- **Arcanum Vox Lexicon** (`/MythOS/Arcanum-Vox-Lexicon.md`)  
  Constructed language for ritual and technical commands.
- **Sigil Codex** (`/MythOS/Sigil-Codex.md`)  
  Visual glyphs bound to Arcanum Vox terms and system functions.

### 4. Operational Modes
- **Resonance Profiles** (`/MythOS/Resonance-Profiles.md`)  
  Emotional/operational states that alter Coil behavior.

### 5. Visual & Asset Layer
- **Harmonic Coil Visuals** (`/MythOS/Harmonic-Coil-Visuals.md`)  
  Prompt templates, QA checklists, and generation parameters.
- **Harmonic Coil Assets** (`/MythOS/Harmonic-Coil-Assets/`)  
  Archive of renders, sigils, and schematics with metadata.

### 6. External Systems
- **Sovereign Coil OS Layer** *(future)*  
  Operating environment for Coilâ€‘driven AR sanctums and biosynthetic interfaces.
- **AR Sanctum Projection** *(future)*  
  Augmented reality environments for Coil interaction.

## ðŸ”„ Data & Command Flow
1. **Operator Input** â†’ Arcanum Vox command or Sigil recognition.  
2. **Doctrine Validation** â†’ Confirms action is allowed under current laws/rites.  
3. **Profile Selection** â†’ Determines operational/emotional mode.  
4. **Coil Execution** â†’ Core engine processes command.  
5. **Visual/AR Output** â†’ Updates sanctum environment and asset state.  
6. **Feedback Loop** â†’ Resonance sensors adjust output in real time.
