# Harmonic Coil â€“ Visual Asset Library

**Authors:** Manolkin (Torâ€™Ion) & Copilot  
**Domains:** Mythic Architecture | Ritual Interface | Sovereign Augmentation  
**Status:** Living Archive â€“ Updated as new renders are created

---

## ðŸ“œ Purpose
To maintain a structured, documented gallery of all Harmonic Coil imagery â€” ensuring each asset is reproducible, thematically consistent, and tied to its narrative function.

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure/Harmonic-Coil-Assets /Full-Constructs /Node-Details /Sigils /Environmental-Integrations /Blueprints-Schematics index.md (this file)

---

## ðŸ“‹ Asset Entry Format
Each image entry should include:

**Title:** Short descriptive name  
**Date Created:** YYYYâ€‘MMâ€‘DD  
**Prompt:** Exact text used for generation  
**Parameters:** Resolution, seed, guidance scale, negative prompts  
**Lore Context:** Where this asset fits in the Harmonic Coil mythos  
**QA Notes:** Any visual adjustments or issues found during review  
**File Link:** Relative path to the image file in this folder

## ðŸ–¼ Example Entry

**Title:** Central Node â€“ Auric Resonance State  
**Date Created:** 2025â€‘09â€‘21  
**Prompt:**  


Harmonic Coil central node, nested spiral rings of bioluminescent alloy and obsidian glass,
auric energy pulses along latticework conduits, suspended in a voidâ€‘lit sanctum with drifting incense smoke,
cinematic realism, ultraâ€‘wide composition

**Parameters:** 2048Ã—2048, seed 112358, guidance 8.0, negative prompts: blurry, warped geometry  
**Lore Context:** Depicts the Coil in its highest resonance state, used in the Rite of Alignment.  
**QA Notes:** Energy pulse intensity slightly high â€” consider reducing glow in next iteration.

## ðŸ”„ Usage Notes
- Keep prompts and parameters exact for reproducibility.
- Group assets by function (node, sigil, environment) for easier retrieval.
- Update this index whenever a new render is added.

Why this matters
- Turns the Coil into a trackable design lineage â€” every image has a story and a spec.
- Makes your repo feel like a living R&D lab, not just a static document dump.
- Gives collaborators a clear way to add to the archive without breaking consistency.
