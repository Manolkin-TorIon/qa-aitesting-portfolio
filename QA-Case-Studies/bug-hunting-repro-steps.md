# Case Study: Bug Hunting & Reproduction Steps

**Author:** Manolkin (Tor’Ion)  
**Role:** QA Tester | Systems Optimizer  
**Date Range:** Ongoing (2024–2025)

## 🎯 Objective
To identify, reproduce, and document software and AI behavior bugs in a way that allows developers to replicate and resolve them without ambiguity.

---

## 🧩 Scope of Work
1. **Exploratory Testing**
   - Pushed systems into edge-case scenarios to reveal hidden logic flaws.
   - Tested across multiple environments (Windows 11, WSL, ROCm/AMD GPU stack).

2. **Reproduction Protocol**
   - Captured exact steps from initial state to bug trigger.
   - Logged environment variables, hardware specs, and software versions.
   - Noted frequency (always, intermittent, rare) and any patterns.

3. **Evidence Gathering**
   - Screenshots and screen recordings of bug occurrence.
   - Copied relevant log excerpts or error codes.
   - Timestamped all findings for traceability.

4. **Developer Handoff**
   - Created concise, actionable bug reports.
   - Included expected vs. actual behavior.
   - Suggested possible causes or related systems for faster triage.

---

## 📊 Key Outcomes
- **30+ reproducible bugs** documented with full repro steps and environment details.
- Reduced developer turnaround time by providing complete, ready-to-test reports.
- Identified **3 critical blockers** before public release in game builds.
- Improved AI conversational stability by flagging context-loss triggers.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environments
- Windows 11 (Insider builds)
- ROCm/AMD GPU stack
- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Microsoft Copilot (AI conversational testing)
- Game testing environments (various studios)

## 📂 Evidence
- [Sample Bug Report 1](./bug-report-samples.md)
- [Sample Bug Report 2](./bug-report-samples.md)

---

## 🔍 Lessons Learned
- Precision in reproduction steps is the difference between a fix and a “cannot reproduce” response.
- Edge-case testing often reveals systemic issues that normal workflows miss.
- Clear, concise communication with developers accelerates resolution.
