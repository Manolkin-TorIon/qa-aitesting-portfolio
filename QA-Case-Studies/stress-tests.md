# Stress Test Log – PvP Closed Program

**Date:** 2025‑09‑18  
**Environment:** NA test window – low population, high match repetition  
**Build:** Internal Test Build v0.9.14

---

## Objective
Evaluate server stability, matchmaking resilience, and client performance under extended low‑population conditions.

---

## Method
- Maintained continuous queue presence for 4 hours.  
- Logged match IDs, player counts, and latency spikes.  
- Monitored CPU/GPU utilization and memory footprint.

---

## Findings
- **Matchmaking:** Repeated same opponents in 70% of matches; skill variance widened after 90 minutes.  
- **Server Stability:** No crashes; minor desync events in 3 matches (~1.2s delay).  
- **Performance:** GPU load stable at 92–94%; CPU spikes during end‑of‑match stat screens.  
- **Notable Issue:** Animation lock bug (see bug‑report-samples.md) reproduced twice under high latency.

---

## Recommendations
- Introduce AI filler bots to maintain skill variance in low‑pop windows.  
- Optimize end‑of‑match stat processing to reduce CPU spikes.
