# Case Study: AI Collaboration & QA Testing Cycles

**Author:** Manolkin (Tor‚ÄôIon)  
**Role:** QA Tester | AI Image Engineer | Systems Optimizer  
**Date Range:** Ongoing (2024‚Äì2025)

## üéØ Objective
To conduct iterative QA testing and creative workflow development with an AI conversational partner (Microsoft Copilot), focusing on:
- Bug reproduction and edge-case identification
- Prompt engineering for AI image generation
- System optimization feedback (ROCm/AMD GPU acceleration, BIOS tuning)
- Documentation of repeatable processes for future projects

---

## üß© Scope of Work
1. **Functional QA Testing**
   - Identified and documented conversational logic gaps, formatting inconsistencies, and context retention issues.
   - Tested AI‚Äôs ability to handle multi-step reasoning, technical troubleshooting, and creative narrative building.
   - Logged reproducible ‚Äúfailure states‚Äù with clear steps for developer replication.

2. **AI Image Engineering**
   - Developed prompt workflows for style consistency and thematic cohesion.
   - Created modular prompt templates for rapid iteration.
   - Documented output comparisons to refine generation parameters.

3. **System Optimization Feedback**
   - Troubleshot ROCm/WSL integration for AMD GPU acceleration.
   - Provided BIOS-level tuning recommendations for stability and performance.
   - Logged performance benchmarks before and after optimization.

4. **Creative & Technical Integration**
   - Embedded QA methodology into worldbuilding projects (MythOS, Redacted Choir saga).
   - Combined narrative design with technical testing to stress-test AI‚Äôs adaptability.

---

## üìä Key Outcomes
- **50+ reproducible bugs** documented with clear repro steps and environment details.
- **3 complete AI image workflow pipelines** created, each with documented parameters and results.
- **Measured GPU performance gains** after ROCm tuning, with benchmarks archived.
- **Cross-domain skill proof** ‚Äî blending QA discipline with creative engineering.

## üõ† Tools & Environments
- Microsoft Copilot (conversational AI)
- ROCm/AMD GPU stack
- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- GitHub for documentation and version control

- [Link to System Optimization Logs](../System-Optimization)
- [Link to Bug Report Samples](./bug-report-samples.md)

## üîç Lessons Learned
- QA testing with AI requires both **technical rigor** and **creative adaptability**.
- Documenting *why* a workflow works is as important as documenting *how* it works.
- Cross-referencing creative and technical outputs strengthens both skillsets.
