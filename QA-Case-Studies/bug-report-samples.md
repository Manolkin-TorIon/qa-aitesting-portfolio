## 📄 Sample 1 – Game Bug (Space Marine 2 PvP)

**Title:** Vanguard Class – Grapple Animation Lock After Interrupt  
**Environment:**  
- Game: Space Marine 2 (Closed PvP Test)  
- Platform: Windows 11 Home (Insider build)  
- GPU: AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE  
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X  
- Network: Wired, 1 Gbps  

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Equip Vanguard class with default melee loadout.  
2. Initiate grapple on enemy player.  
3. Have a third player interrupt grapple with ranged attack during animation wind‑up.  
4. Attempt to move or attack after animation break.

**Expected Result:**  
Player regains control immediately after grapple is interrupted.

**Actual Result:**  
Player remains locked in grapple animation pose for 3–5 seconds, unable to move or attack.

**Severity:** High (affects combat flow in competitive matches)  
**Attachments:** Video clip + frame‑time graph showing input lock duration.

## 📄 Sample 2 – AI Workflow Bug (Mythic Portrait Series)

**Title:** Harmonic Coil Sigil Rendering Inconsistent Across Iterations  
**Environment:**  
- AI Platform: [Model/Version]  
- Prompt: Mythic Portrait Series template with fixed seed  
- Parameters: 1024×1024, Guidance 7.5, Negative prompts active  

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Use provided prompt template with fixed seed.  
2. Generate 10 iterations, changing only lighting descriptor.  
3. Compare sigil rendering in each output.

**Expected Result:**  
Sigil shape and placement remain consistent across all iterations.

**Actual Result:**  
Sigil distorts or disappears entirely in ~30% of outputs.

**Severity:** Medium (affects visual consistency in published series)  
**Attachments:** Iteration gallery with annotations.

## 📄 Sample 3 – System Optimization Bug (ROCm on WSL2)

**Title:** ROCm Kernel Panic Under High Parallel Load  
**Environment:**  
- OS: Windows 11 Home (Insider build)  
- WSL2: Ubuntu 22.04  
- GPU: AMD Radeon RX 7900 GRE  
- ROCm Version: [Insert version]  

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Launch Stable Diffusion batch job (batch size 8).  
2. Run simultaneous Blender GPU render in WSL2.  
3. Monitor GPU utilization and kernel logs.

**Expected Result:**  
Both workloads complete without driver crash.

**Actual Result:**  
ROCm kernel panic after ~2 minutes, WSL session terminates.

**Severity:** Critical (causes data loss and requires system restart)  
**Attachments:** ROCm kernel log excerpt + GPU utilization chart.
