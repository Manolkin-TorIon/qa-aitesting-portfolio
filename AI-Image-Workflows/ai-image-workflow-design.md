## 🎯 Objective
To design, test, and refine AI image generation workflows that produce consistent, high-quality outputs across multiple prompts, sessions, and thematic constraints.

---

## 🧩 Scope of Work
1. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Developed modular prompt templates for rapid iteration.
   - Incorporated style anchors, thematic keywords, and composition cues.
   - Balanced creative freedom with reproducibility.

2. **Style Consistency Testing**
   - Ran controlled tests varying only one parameter at a time (seed, style tag, lighting).
   - Compared outputs for fidelity to target style and subject accuracy.
   - Logged deviations and adjusted prompts to tighten consistency.

3. **Workflow Documentation**
   - Created step-by-step guides for each workflow.
   - Included recommended parameter ranges, seed values, and negative prompts.
   - Archived example outputs for visual reference.

4. **Cross-Platform Validation**
   - Tested workflows across different AI image models to ensure portability.
   - Noted differences in interpretation and adjusted prompts for cross-model stability.

---

## 📊 Key Outcomes
- **3 fully documented workflows** capable of producing consistent results over 20+ iterations.
- Reduced style drift by **~40%** through parameter tuning and prompt refinement.
- Created a reusable **prompt library** for future projects and collaborations.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environments
- AI image generation platforms (various)
- Markdown for workflow documentation
- GitHub for version control and sharing

## 📂 Evidence
- [Workflow 1: Mythic Portrait Series](./mythic-portrait-series.md)
- [Workflow 2: Environmental Concept Art](./environmental-concept-art.md)
- [Workflow 3: Technical Diagram Generation](./technical-diagram-generation.md)

---

## 🔍 Lessons Learned
- Consistency requires **controlled variation** — change one thing at a time.
- Negative prompts are as important as positive ones for eliminating unwanted artifacts.
- Cross-model testing ensures workflows aren’t locked to a single platform.
