# Workflow 1: Mythic Portrait Series

**Author:** Manolkin (Tor’Ion)  
**Role:** AI Image Engineer | Creative Systems Architect  
**Date Range:** Ongoing (2024–2025)

## 🎯 Objective
To create a repeatable AI image generation workflow for producing **mythic, character‑driven portraits** with consistent style, lighting, and thematic resonance — suitable for integration into the Redacted Choir saga and other narrative projects.

---

## 🧩 Workflow Design

### 1. **Prompt Framework**
- **Base Structure:**[Subject: Character name + role/title]
[Descriptors: physical traits, attire, symbolic elements]
[Mood/Atmosphere: lighting, tone, emotional cadence]
[Art Style: painterly realism, chiaroscuro, mythic tone]
- **Example Prompt:**Tor’Ion, Harmonic Architect of the Redacted Choir,
silver‑braided hair, ceremonial warplate with harmonic coil sigils,
standing in a storm‑lit sanctum,
painterly realism, chiaroscuro lighting, oil on canvas texture

---

### 2. **Parameter Settings**
- **Resolution:** 1024×1024 (portrait format)
- **Seed Control:** Fixed seed for consistency across iterations
- **Guidance Scale:** 7.5–8.0 for strong adherence to prompt
- **Negative Prompts:** “blurry, distorted hands, extra limbs, text artifacts”

---

### 3. **Testing & Iteration**
- **Round 1:** Generate 10 images with fixed seed, varying only lighting descriptors.
- **Round 2:** Lock lighting, vary attire and symbolic elements.
- **Round 3:** Cross‑model test to ensure portability of prompt structure.

---

### 4. **Quality Assurance Checks**
- **Style Consistency:** Compare against reference portraits for color palette and brushstroke fidelity.
- **Anatomical Accuracy:** Check facial symmetry, hand structure, and proportion.
- **Symbol Integrity:** Ensure harmonic coil sigils render correctly in at least 80% of outputs.

---

## 📊 Key Outcomes
- Achieved **~85% style consistency** across 30+ iterations.
- Reduced symbol distortion by **~40%** through negative prompt tuning.
- Created a **prompt template** now used for other character portraits in the saga.

- **Prompt Template File:** [Link to prompt-template.md]  
- **QA Comparison Sheet:** [Link to style-consistency-checklist.md]

---

## 🔍 Lessons Learned
- Fixed seeds are essential for controlled variation testing.
- Symbolic elements require iterative refinement and targeted negative prompts.
- Cross‑model validation prevents overfitting to a single AI platform.

*This workflow blends narrative artistry with QA discipline, ensuring each portrait is both visually compelling and technically reproducible.*
