## 🎯 Objective
To design and refine AI workflows for generating **large‑scale, immersive environments** that maintain thematic cohesion, spatial logic, and visual fidelity — suitable for narrative backdrops, game levels, and AR sanctum builds.

---

## 🧩 Workflow Design

### 1. **Prompt Framework**[Environment Type: biome, architecture, or hybrid]
[Key Features: terrain, structures, flora/fauna, weather]
[Mood/Atmosphere: lighting, tone, narrative context]
[Art Style: cinematic realism, painterly, or stylized]

**Example Prompt:**Harmonic Coil Sanctuary,
vast cathedral‑like chamber carved into a mountainside,
bioluminescent vines draping from vaulted arches,
mist‑laden air with shafts of golden light,
cinematic realism, ultra‑wide composition

---

### 2. **Parameter Settings**
- **Resolution:** 1920×1080 (landscape) or 2048×1024 for panoramic
- **Seed Control:** Fixed for iterative refinement
- **Guidance Scale:** 7.0–8.5 depending on adherence needs
- **Negative Prompts:** “blurry, warped perspective, floating geometry, text artifacts”

---

### 3. **Testing & Iteration**
- **Round 1:** Generate 5–10 variations with fixed seed, altering only lighting and weather.
- **Round 2:** Lock lighting/weather, vary architectural or terrain details.
- **Round 3:** Cross‑model test for portability and style retention.

---

### 4. **Quality Assurance Checks**
- **Spatial Logic:** Perspective lines and scale relationships must be consistent.
- **Thematic Cohesion:** All elements must fit the narrative setting.
- **Detail Integrity:** No major artifacts in focal areas (e.g., warped arches, broken textures).

---

## 📊 Key Outcomes
- Produced **3 fully documented environment workflows** with consistent thematic fidelity.
- Reduced perspective distortion by **~35%** through prompt and parameter tuning.
- Created a **library of environmental descriptors** for rapid scene prototyping.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environments
- AI image generation platforms (various)
- Markdown for workflow documentation
- GitHub for version control and archival

---

## 📂 Evidence
- [Workflow Gallery](./environment-gallery.md)
- [Prompt Template – Environments](./environment-prompt-template.md)
- [QA Checklist – Environments](./environment-qa-checklist.md)

---

## 🔍 Lessons Learned
- Wide compositions require careful prompt balancing to avoid empty or chaotic space.
- Environmental mood is heavily influenced by lighting descriptors — small changes have large impact.
- Cross‑model validation ensures environments remain consistent across platforms.

*This workflow demonstrates the ability to scale AI image generation from intimate portraits to expansive, narrative‑driven environments.*
