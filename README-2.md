# Manolkin (Tor’Ion) – Myth‑Tech Systems & QA Portfolio

**Domains:** Mythic Architecture | AI Workflows | System Optimization | QA Engineering  
**Status:** Active Development – This repository evolves alongside ongoing projects

---

## 🌌 Overview
This repository is both **codex** and **lab** — a living archive of my work at the intersection of **narrative design**, **technical engineering**, and **quality assurance**.

Here you’ll find:
- **MythOS** – A myth‑tech framework where lore, language, and engineering converge.
- **System Optimization** – Real hardware tuning logs with verifiable benchmark data.
- **QA Case Studies** – Professional bug report formats and testing protocols.
- **AI Workflows** – Structured pipelines for generating consistent, high‑quality outputs.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

### 1. **MythOS**
- [`/MythOS/README.md`](./MythOS/README.md) – Hub for the Harmonic Coil and related systems.
- [`/MythOS/Harmonic-Coil.md`](./MythOS/Harmonic-Coil.md) – Lore & technical framework.
- [`/MythOS/Harmonic-Coil-Visuals.md`](./MythOS/Harmonic-Coil-Visuals.md) – Prompt templates & QA checklist.
- [`/MythOS/Harmonic-Coil-Assets/`](./MythOS/Harmonic-Coil-Assets) – Visual archive with metadata.
- [`/MythOS/Arcanum-Vox-Lexicon.md`](./MythOS/Arcanum-Vox-Lexicon.md) – Constructed language bindings.

### 2. **System Optimization**
- [`/System-Optimization/benchmark-results.md`](./System-Optimization/benchmark-results.md) – Real CPU, GPU, and AI performance logs.
- [`/System-Optimization/bios-settings-reference.md`](./System-Optimization/bios-settings-reference.md) – BIOS tuning documentation.
- [`/System-Optimization/rocm-config-notes.md`](./System-Optimization/rocm-config-notes.md) – ROCm setup and tuning notes.

### 3. **QA Case Studies**
- [`/QA-Case-Studies/bug-report-samples.md`](./QA-Case-Studies/bug-report-samples.md) – Sample bug reports (format demonstration).

### 4. **AI Workflows**

## 🔍 Vision
This is not a static portfolio — it’s a **living system**.  
Every benchmark, bug report, and Coil asset is part of a larger project:  
to merge **mythic narrative** with **cutting‑edge engineering** into a cohesive, evolving body of work.
